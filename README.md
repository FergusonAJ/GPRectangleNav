This project was a super simple implementation of genetic programming that I created for ETGG4803: Artificial Intelligence. 
The Golang code handles the genetic programming, as it generates Lisp code. The Golang also runs a simulation of a box in a rectangular area. The controller executes the Lisp code every step, and the output of that code determines how the box moves. 

The code is definitely not elegant, it is admittedly pretty thrown together. However, the program has successfully evolved in as few as 17 generations!
